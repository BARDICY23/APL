2. Generators return all values at once like a list.
Answer: False

3. Coroutines can both produce values and receive input using

Answer: True

4. The Factory pattern is used to notify multiple observers when the state of an objec

Short Answer / Conceptual Questions
1. What is the difference between a generator and a coroutine in Python?


Answer: A generator produces values lazily using yield, while a coroutine can also
consume values sent into it using send (). Coroutines are often used for event-driven

programming and concurrency.
2. Explain why the with statement is preferred over manual resource management.
Answer: The with statement ensures resources (like files, sockets, or locks) are

ADVANCED PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON

automatically cleaned up via ___exit__(), even if an exception
occurs, making code safer and cleaner.
3. Give a real-world example where the Observer pattern might be
applied.
Answer: In a stock trading app, multiple UI components (observers) need to
be updated whenever stock prices (subject state) change.
4. What problem does the Factory pattern
solve?
Answer: It abstracts object creation, allowing clients to create objects without

depending on their concrete classes.
5. How does Dependency Injection improve testability of
code?
Answer: It allows dependencies (like services or databases) to be swapped out
with mock objects during testing, making unit tests easier and more isolated.
