  Answer: True

- pandas can read both CSV and JSON files into DataFrames.
  Answer: True

- The default file format supported by pandas.read_excel is .xlsx.
  Answer: True

- Excel files can be written using pandas without any external library.
  Answer: False (openpyxl is required for .xlsx files)
